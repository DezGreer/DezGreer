  <h2> About me</h2>
  <p>I currently live in Dallas, Texas, but I am origianlly from Detroit, Michigan.I am a mother of 2 and the oldest of 7. I am going to school with Uber's scholarship program. I honestly can't believe I'm starting school again, but I'm so excited and have learned so much already.I am looking forward to the rest of my school journey as I embark on my career change. After graduation I plan on going into the Al field and Ux design. My goal is to work project based jobs from home so I can spend more time with my girls. </p>
- âš¡ Fun fact: I design kids clothes.
